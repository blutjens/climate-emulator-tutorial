    Does pattern scaling. Here we fit one linear model per 
    grid point. The linear model maps a global variable, 
    e.g., temperature, to the grid point's local value. 
    This model captures temporal patterns in each grid cell.
    The model is local, i.e., it will be independent of 
    neighboring grid points. The model is linear in time, 
    i.e., it assumes no non-linearly amplifying feedbacks 
    between the global and local variable.
