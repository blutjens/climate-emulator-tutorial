# List of todo's

[] test environment.yml
[x] download data locally to avoid google colab...
[x] declutter notebook by moving autoregressiveDataset and unet_model into python files
[] data exploration:
    [] plot pixel wise frequency of TAS values
        - calculate running sum of histogram over all images TAS images
    [] plot accuracy (y-axis) over pixel-wise binned TAS prediction value, where TAS prediction values are ordered according to frequency (or TAS if TAS itself is Gaussian distributed)
    [] plot all 740 training data samples. I want to know if I can learn as a human how to do the prediction task.
