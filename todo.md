# List of todo's

work on eie -- *tutorial* -- (next step)

publish ready:
    [] test environment.yml
        [] with new laptop 
    [] clean table of contents
        restart and use "markdown all in one: create table of contents" command
    [] how to integrate polynomial pattern scaling?
        [] move complexity over performance into discussion

clarify take-aways:
    [] co2, ch4, bc, so2 are a lot of greenhouse gases ->> need common unit
    [] internal variability is open challenge ->> need ensemble members
    [] global CO2 -> local T is mostly linear ->> need more difficult variables
    [] global co2 -> local T has errors in Arctic, Antarctica in linear model. ->> need long-/short term network (such as lstm) to get rid of those
    [] global CO2 -> precip??
model development
    [] calculate NRMSE to compare with climatebench
    [] create a linear time difference model
        [] calculate tas(t)-tas(t-1) on smoothened data.
            Could I also smoothen the difference instead? I don't think so, it looks so noisy..
            Need to calculate difference using polynomial
            [] Fix the bug that timesteps dont seem to match
        [] drop duplicate time data in time-instant linear regression model
        [x] calculate inputs: time-difference vector tas(t) - tas(t-1)
        [x] calculate outputs: locally-resolved tas(t, xy)
            --> see why double check is wrong at some points.
        [] retrain patternscaling model for this in/output combination
            [x] write raw code to extend patternscaling code to multi-variate
            [x] text code extension for multi-variate linear patternscaling.
            [] 
        [] evaluate if that gets the north atlantic cold blob right
    [] write train.py s.t., i can plug in an fcnn, unet, etc. given a dataloader?
        [] rewrite dataloader, s.t., the explore_data scipt saves an ML-ready dataset in processed/. The train.py then takes in a path to that dataset and creates a dataloader.
        [] rewrite criterion s.t., it's an argument in cfg
        [] maybe get rid of click.x
    [] can ML do at least as good as current emulators?
        [] *Linear&FaiRGP: map annual cum. CO2 emission + (CH4,SO2,BC) emissions at time t linearly to global T at t. then map global T patterns to local T*
            [x] map co2 -> T
            [] *map co2, ch4, bc, so2 -> T* -- do I even need that because ch4,bc,so2 have such little impact on the global scale?
                - adding so2 might improve the 1960-2000 fit?
                - adding so2 might improve accuracy with held-out ssp370 in india&china
                - adding ch4, bc, so2 would allow en-roads integration?
    [] ClimateBench: map global cum. CO2 emissions + global CH4 emis. + spatially-resolved annual (SO2,BC) at time t to local T
        [] Linear: map annual cum. CO2 emission + (CH4,SO2,BC) emissions at time t linearly to global T at t. Then map global T + (SO2, BC) maps to local T maps
    [] Nat-Var-FCNN: map 10yr cum. co2 + (CH4, SO2, BC) time-series to 10 yr avg local T) 
    [] how would i build a model that gets arctic right?
        - linear model underestimates cooling in that area in ssp245
            - co2 from 10-20 y ago initiates greenland melt? 
        -- non trivial!
data exploration:
    [] clone explore_temperature for precip
    [] why is the cnn-lstm better in the arctic than linear model?
        - is this due to long- short term memory?
        - what are the inputs to the cnn again? 
            global cum. co2 emission (t-10:t)
            global      ch4 emission (t-10:t)
            local       bc  emission (t-10:t)
            local       so2 emission (t-10:t)
            + latent state?
        - what are the outputs?
            local       tas          (t)
        - the Arctic signal is Not in the bc, so2 data
        - is this a result of data leakage -> probably not bc all of ssp245 is held-out.
        - Is the Arctic warming different for ssp370 and ssp585 at 4500GtCO2? The ssp245 has 4500GtCO2 in 2100; so a linear model in the Arctic will predict the average between ssp370(t=2070, co2=4050)  and ssp585(t=2050, co2=4050)
            - If the arctic warming is different for ssp370 and ssp585 that could explain why the CO2 history helps the CNN to predict arctic warming better 
                - Maybe a co2 value + gradient would be sufficient for that though:)
                    ----->>>>>> TEST:::::: DOES LINEAR MODEL[T(t), T(t)-T(t-1)] get Arctic warming right?
            - 4500 GtCO2 = co2(ssp245, 2100) = co2(ssp370,2070) = co2(ssp585,2050)
    [] How to deal with internal variability?
        [] could smoothen global T and then map co2 onto global T
    [] When does the linear pattern scaling break down?
        [] Does the linear assumption break down during rare events?
        could plot accuracy (y-axis) over pixel-wise binned TAS prediction value, where TAS prediction values are ordered according to frequency (or TAS if TAS itself is Gaussian distributed)
    [] get so2 and bc -- where are they?
	[] plot ch4, so2, and bc over time like climatebench fig1 
    [x] plot all 740 training data samples. I want to know if I can learn as a human how to do the prediction task. 
        [] find out why 'tas' runs from -3 to +5? Am I plotting delta tas? But at which point have I dont the conversion.
        [] plot spatially-resolved 20year average tas on right and global co2 concentrations over time on left. The question is if I can see a mapping in between the co2 and local tas values?
    [] create scatterplot of co2 to each pixel? to see if co2 relates locally linearly to tas
    [] create 2nd order polynomial fit instead of pattern scaling. I'm interested if there's good trends in the global T vs. local T plot.
demo development
    [] expand piecewise linear to map all_ghg -> T
    [] use co2 emission over time curve.
        [] create co2(t) = by piecewise linear interpolation of co2(ssp127,ssp585(t))
        [] plot co2 emission curve
    [] add ch4, etc. as optional arguments at the bottom

Beyond tutorial:
[] Download 3hr tas, huss, ps from esgf cnrm-esm2-1 for 2014-2100 for ssp585-over and 1 ensemble member.
    [] The 3 models for ssp585-over are not enough to avg out internal variability
    [] The 12 model for ssp127 should be enough.
    --> that goes beyond this emulator tutorial.
